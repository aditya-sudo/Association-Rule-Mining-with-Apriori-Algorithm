# 🎞️ Association Rule Mining on Movie Ratings with Apriori Algorithm

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores **association rule mining** by implementing the **Apriori algorithm** from scratch to discover frequent movie-watching patterns among users. The analysis is based on transforming a user-movie interaction dataset into transactions and identifying frequent itemsets and strong rules.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Implement the Apriori algorithm from scratch using Python.
- Preprocess user-movie interaction data into transaction format.
- Extract frequent movie combinations watched together using support and confidence thresholds.
- Generate meaningful association rules that reveal user behavior trends.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- DefaultDict & itertools
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

- **movie_rated.txt**: Contains user-movie viewing pairs.
- **movies.csv**: Maps movie IDs to human-readable movie titles.
- Each user is treated as a transaction of movie IDs.

## 📈 Results

- Discovered frequent movie combinations using a **minimum support of 0.2** and **confidence threshold of 0.8**.
- Generated human-readable association rules (e.g., users who watch X also tend to watch Y).
- Illustrated the usefulness of Apriori in extracting insights from behavioral data.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Gained practical experience with association rule mining and market basket analysis.
- Deepened understanding of frequent pattern mining, itemsets, support, and confidence.
- Developed custom Apriori logic and data transformation pipelines.
